# pytorch-image-classification

Application of neural networks for image classification using Pytorch.
The network instance in the Jupyter notebook is trained on Imagewoof dataset.

The project in the Jupyter notebook is broken down into three main steps:

1. Load and pre-process the image datasets
2. Train the image classifier on the training dataset
3. Use the trained classifier to predict dogs breed

Used libraries: torch, torchvision, torchsummary, matplotlib, multiprocessing, os, tarfile, time
