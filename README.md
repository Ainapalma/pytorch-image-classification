# pytorch-image-classification

Application of neural networks for image classification using Pytorch.
The network instance in the Jupyter notebook is trained on Imagewoof dataset.

### Jupyter notebook [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Ainapalma/pytorch-image-classification/blob/main/imagewoof_classifier_pytorch.ipynb)

The project in the Jupyter notebook is broken down into three main steps:

1. Load and pre-process the image datasets
2. Train the image classifier on the training dataset
3. Use the trained classifier to predict dogs breed

### Python libraries

The Jupyter Notebook and the Python modules require the following Python libraries: torch, torchvision, torchsummary, matplotlib, multiprocessing, os, tarfile, time
